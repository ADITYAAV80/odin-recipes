        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b><br>
            In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt.<br>
            Add chicken pieces and coat them well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            
            <li><b>Prepare the Rice:</b><br>
            Rinse basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak for 30 minutes.<br>
            In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add cloves, cardamom pods, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and salt.<br>
            Add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70% cooked (the rice should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</li>
            
            <li><b>Cook the Chicken:</b><br>
            Heat ghee or oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium heat.<br>
            Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Then add sliced onions and cook until golden brown.<br>
            Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies, and cook until tomatoes are soft.<br>
            Add marinated chicken and cook until it's browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally. <br>
            Adjust seasoning with salt and add coriander powder and biryani masala.
            </li>
            

            <li><b>Layer the Biryani:</b><br>
            In the same pot or a separate heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of the partially cooked rice over the chicken.<br>
            Sprinkle chopped coriander and mint leaves over the rice. If using, drizzle saffron milk over the top.<br>
            Optionally, add some fried onions for extra flavor.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Dum Cooking:</b><br>
            Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam if you prefer.<br>
            Cook on very low heat for 25-30 minutes. This step allows the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.
            </li>


            <li><b>Serve:</b><br>
            Gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, or pickle.<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        Enjoy your homemade biryani!<br>
