        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rice Texture:</b>Use cold, day-old rice if possible. It’s drier and less likely to become mushy compared to freshly cooked rice.</li>
            <li><b>Vegetable Options:</b> Feel free to customize the vegetables based on your preference or what you have on hand. Bell peppers,<br> 
            corn, or mushrooms can also be great additions.</li>
            <li><b>Protein Variations:</b>You can replace the chicken with other proteins like shrimp, pork, or tofu.</li>
